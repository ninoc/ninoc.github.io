								<b>Gamma-ray Bursts</b><br>Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) are the most powerful explosions that occur in the Universe. 
								The gamma-ray emission can last from a fraction of second to a few minutes, delivering an cumulative amount of energy thousands of times
								larger that the most powerful known supernova. I study the chemical enrichment of the Universe using long GRBs optical and infrared 
								afterglow emission. Through absorption spectroscopy technique I derive the accurate distance of these GRBs as well as the chemical makeup of the 
								GRB progenitor star interstella medium, as well as the integalactic medium of all objects between the GRB and us.<br> 
								<p class="italic-text"> What is cool about GRBs?</p> GRBs give us a direct view of the first generation of stars, something otherwise impossible to do, as well as a unbiased 
								map of the chemical enrichment of the Universe across timescale, galaxy types, and location in the sky.
							</p>
							<p>
								<b>Gravitational Waves progenitors</b><br>In 2017 a new type of radiation was detected in the sky. Predicted by Albert Einstein, 
								for the first time we were able to detect Gravitational Waves produced during the merger of two compact objects (like black hole binaries, 
								neutron stars). These gravitational waves (GW) are not the typical emission you can detect with telescops, but require special instruments, like the 
								LIGO, Virgo and Kagra experiments, which have been developed over the past decades in different parts of the World. 
								Because we know that the short class of GRBs (sGRBs), which we observed in electromagnetic bands, are likely produced by similar merger phenomena
								I am interesting in better understanding these phenomena combining both the data coming from the GW detectors, electromagnetic emission observed by 
								telescopes on Earth and in space, as well as theoretical predictions.
